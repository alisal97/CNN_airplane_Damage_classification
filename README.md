# CNN_airplane_Damage_classification
A notebook for the dataset https://universe.roboflow.com/nicola-mauriello/airplane-ryx4q/dataset/1, which is able to classify damage in airplanes whether it's a Abrasion, crack or dent. Using convolutional neural networks, with a comparison of 3 models, which are VGG16, LeNet 5 and a customly defined model of 12 layers.
